# HuBMAP Files API

The files-api service is a RESTful web service used to access file information and register files.
Three types of IDs are supported:
 * `uuid`: Standard randomly generated 128 bit UUIDs represented as 32 hexadecimal digits. These are generated by the service.
 * `hubmap_id`: A randomly generated unique id that can be used to construct a HuBMAP DOI in the format ######.XXXX.###. 
 * `submission_id`: Only gets generated for Donor and Sample, e.g., UFL0007
